# Report-Analysis
Introduction:
When monitoring patients over time, clinicians may struggle to distinguish ‘real changes’ in consecutive blood parameters from so-called natural fluctuations. In practice, they have to do so by relying on their clinical experience and intuition. We developed Blood Test Report Analysis, a medical web application that calculates the probability that an increase or decrease over time in a specific blood parameter is real, given the time between measurements.
The laboratory parameters that were incorporated in the cases were: haemoglobin, leucocytes, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin B12, alanine aminotransferase, glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin type A1c (HbA1c), creatinine, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and C reactive protein.
